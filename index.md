## Course Description

Personal informatics systems are those that help people collect personally relevant information for the purpose of
self-reflection and gaining self-knowledge. These systems are increasingly prevalent, across diverse goals that
include behavior change support (e.g., weight loss, increased exercise, improved productivity), better knowing oneself
or satisfying curiosity (e.g., seeing spending patterns or places visited visualized), discovering new content
(e.g., music or movie tracking to feed a recommender system), connecting with friends, or simply keeping a record
for documentary purposes. 

These advances create new challenges for collecting, integrating, sharing, reflecting, and acting on large amounts
of personal data. The tools for these activities must also fit into the everyday lives and routines of the people
that use them. This seminar will review progress and discuss current frontiers in each of these challenges.

Each week will consistent of paper reading, presentation, and discussion. 
In contrast to the highly-curated presentation of content in a more introductory course,
students will be expected to contribute to all aspects of the definition and content of this course.
This will include identifying relevant content and contributing to discussion of that content.

Over the quarter, students will develop an group research project in the area of personal informatics.

We will emphasize open discussion and feedback in all aspects of the course.

## Readings

~~~
Assigned readings will often focus on research topics, generally consisting of:

- A _historic framing_ paper: presenting a theory, language, or understanding that can
  help in understanding and contextualizing the contributions of additional research.

- Two papers that provide _more recent or specific contributions_:
  presenting the type of contribution you might initially be expected to attempt in your research.

You are expected to read: (1) the historical framing paper, and (2) either of the more current papers
(in other words, whichever seems more compelling or interesting to you). You obviously may choose to read all three.
The calendar will link to assigned readings and provide any day-specific revisions to this reading structure. 

You are expected to have read and considered the assigned readings prior to class,
as the in-class discussions are a critical component of this course.
~~~

### Reading Reports

~~~
To help prepare for an engaging and meaningful discussion, we require posting thoughts and questions beforehand.
You can start a new discussion, participate in an existing discussion, or do a bit of both.
You can discuss all of the assigned readings, or focus on a portion of the reading that you found most interesting. 
The important part is that we can see intellectual effort in your forum participation, not just a simple paper summary.

We will create Canvas discussion threads for each paper.
If you have a thought or question that relates to multiple papers, post it wherever seems more appropriate.

Your participation in the forum discussion for each day will be graded on a scale from 0 to 3.

- 0: If you do not participate.
- 1: If your participation seems weak and does not convince us you read, understood, and considered the readings.
- 2: If your participation shows you read and understood the readings and had something interesting to say.
     This will be the most common grade.
- 3: Reserved for especially insightful participation.

It is generally easy to find something to criticize in any piece of research.
But focusing exclusively on the potential flaws of research is generally not productive. 
You will generally find it more intellectually worthwhile to focus on aspects of work that are particularly well done, 
new ideas are prompted by a piece of work, or what you might have done differently if you conducted the research. 
This will also lead to much more valuable discussions.

Potential topics for discussion are:

- What idea or innovation enabled this, what more might be done based on that idea or innovation?
- What new questions or research agendas are suggested by this research?
- How might this research have informed some other research you have seen?
- What aspects of this work were particularly well done or effective?
- If you had conducted this research, what would you have done differently?

As we note in [Submission](#submission), reading discussion must be posted by the night before each class meeting.
This ensures time to review discussion the next morning before class.

Feel free to continue a discussion after this, even after class.

## Project

~~~
A course project will be a major component of your work. Details of the project are here:

<{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assignments/project.html>

Dates are also linked from the course calendar.

Some sample project ideas, gathered from faculty and researchers, have been made available here:

<https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1021534/discussion_topics/3155256>
~~~

## Grading

Grading will roughly correspond to:

~~~
- 20%: Readings
- 60%: Group Project
- 20%: Participation
~~~

Much of the grading in this course is necessarily subjective.
We will attempt to communicate expectations and feedback throughout the course, 
but it is your responsibility to communicate with us if you feel you would like guidance in this regard.

## Submission

Submissions will be coordinated using Canvas:

<https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1060429>

Many assignments are due "the night before class". We will implement this in Canvas as 4:00am the day of class.

This gives staff time to review submissions before class.
Submitting the day of class, just before class, or in class is therefore unacceptable, risking zero credit.
